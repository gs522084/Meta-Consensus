## 🧠 What is Meta-Consensus?

**Meta-Consensus is a foundational protocol.** It does not produce a single consensus on a specific question. Instead, it defines the **rules of the game**—the economic and algorithmic processes—by which any question can be answered through the emergent, collective intelligence of its participants.

Think of it not as an oracle, but as the **substrate upon which oracles are built.** It's the difference between a single verdict and the entire legal system that produces verdicts.

### The Core Problem

Current decentralized systems (DAOs, Blockchains, Prediction Markets) are fragile because their consensus mechanisms are:
- **Static:** Rules are hard-coded and cannot adapt to new types of problems.
- **Siloed:** Each system forms its own isolated consensus, unable to leverage a global truth.
- **Shallow:** They focus on "what" is true, not "how" we know it's true or "what we can do" with that truth.

**Meta-Consensus solves this by creating a recursive, self-improving system for truth discovery and capability creation.**

## ⚙️ How It Works: The Three-Layer Architecture

The protocol operates through three interconnected layers, forming a self-reinforcing cycle of intelligence.

### Layer 1: The Bimodal Truth Engine
This is the base layer where raw consensus is formed on any statement.
- **Objective Mode:** For verifiable facts. Uses staking and slashing to economically punish misinformation and reward accurate data.
- **Subjective Mode:** For values, predictions, and complex judgments. Uses a continuous belief market to reach a gradient consensus, quantifying collective confidence.

### Layer 2: The Functional Emergence Protocol
This is the "Meta" layer. It allows the system to bootstrap itself from knowledge into capability.
- **Capability Proposal:** The community can propose to formalize a solidified consensus into a callable function (e.g., "We all agree on arithmetic rules, so let's ratify a `Calculator` service").
- **Staking-based Ratification:** The proposal is validated through a specialized staking round, testing its reliability and utility. If successful, it becomes a new primitive for the ecosystem.

### Layer 3: The Economic Flywheel
A tokenomic model that powers and secures the entire system, aligning individual rationality with collective truth-seeking.
- **Stake-to-Participate:** Prevents Sybil attacks and ensures skin-in-the-game.
- **Earn-for-Value:** Participants are rewarded for contributing data and logic that the system finds useful, creating a market for truth.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This repository contains a simulation framework to experiment with the Meta-Consensus protocol.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the protocol repository
git clone https://github.com/gs522084/meta-consensus.git
cd meta-consensus

# Install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running a Simulation
See the system in action by running a basic emergence simulation:

bash
python examples/run_emergence.py
Basic Usage Example
python
from meta_consensus import MetaConsensusProtocol
from meta_consensus.modalities import ObjectiveMode

# Initialize a protocol instance
protocol = MetaConsensusProtocol()

# Define a simple objective claim
claim = "The capital of Japan is Tokyo."

# Let the protocol reach a consensus using its internal staking mechanics
result = protocol.achieve_consensus(
    claim=claim,
    modality=ObjectiveMode(),
    timeout_blocks=10
)

print(f"Consensus Reached: {result.consensus_reached}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence:.2f}")
print(f"Participants in Consensus: {result.participant_count}")

🧪 Research & Development
Meta-Consensus is an active research project. We are exploring:

🔬 Formal Verification: Mathematically proving the safety and liveness of the protocol.

🎯 Advanced Game Theory: Designing resistance to more sophisticated attacks.

🌐 Cross-Domain Applications: Using Meta-Consensus as a backbone for decentralized science, governance, and finance.

We need your help! Join us in:

The Meta-Discussion: Debate the fundamental rules of the protocol.

Code Contribution: Help build the simulation and eventually, a production implementation.

Academic Collaboration: Formalize the mathematics and write papers.

⚠️ Research in Progress
This is alpha-stage research software. The concepts are ambitious and unproven. The code is for simulation and demonstration purposes. Expect breaking changes and spirited philosophical debates.

The future of consensus is not a destination. It's a process. Let's build the process.
